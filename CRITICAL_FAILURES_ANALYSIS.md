# Critical Failures Analysis - Projects 89 & 99

## Executive Summary
Both projects 89 and 99 experienced cascading failures due to systemic issues in session tracking, error logging, and state synchronization. The root causes have been identified and partially fixed.

## Detailed Analysis

### Project 89: Mobile App Spec V2
**Current Status:** Failed - "Stuck for 5+ hours without session"

#### Timeline
1. Initial run completed but with missing CLAUDE.md warnings
2. Session died silently (no tmux session found)
3. Database lacks session_name, preventing detection
4. Marked as stuck after timeout

#### Root Causes
1. **Missing Session Tracking**: Database columns `session_name`, `orchestrator_session`, `main_session` are NULL
2. **Session Death**: Tmux session crashed/terminated but process continued
3. **State Desync**: SessionStateManager and database out of sync

### Project 99: Test Spec (P5)
**Current Status:** Failed - "Subprocess failed: None"

#### Timeline
1. Initial NameError for BriefingSystem (fixed)
2. Quick failure (5 seconds) with no error details
3. Session created but not tracked in database
4. **DISCOVERY**: Session `test-spec-713384c9` is STILL ACTIVE!

#### Root Causes
1. **Poor Error Capture**: `e.stderr` was None, leading to unhelpful error message
2. **Session Not Tracked**: Database has no session_name despite active session
3. **False Failure**: Project marked failed but session is running

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Subprocess Error Logging
```python
# Before: error_msg = f"Subprocess failed: {e.stderr}"
# After: Captures return code, stderr, stdout, and command
error_msg = f"Subprocess failed with return code {e.returncode}: stderr={stderr_content}, stdout={stdout_content}, cmd={e.cmd}"
```

### 2. BriefingSystem Import Fix
```python
# Added local import in _brief_agents method
from ..agents.briefing_system import BriefingSystem, BriefingContext, ProjectSpec as BriefingProjectSpec
```

### 3. Resource Validation
```python
# Added _validate_worktree_resources method
# Checks for missing CLAUDE.md and other critical files
```

### 4. Database Session Tracking (Manual Fix)
```sql
UPDATE project_queue SET session_name = 'test-spec-713384c9', status = 'processing' WHERE id = 99;
```

## Systemic Issues Identified

### 1. Session Name Population Gap
The system creates sessions but doesn't update the database with session names, causing:
- Session detection failures
- False "stuck" determinations
- Recovery loops

### 2. Error Swallowing
Multiple layers swallow errors:
- Subprocess exceptions lose details
- OAuth manager catches but doesn't propagate
- State sync silently fails

### 3. Recovery Loop Problem
- System detects issues → triggers recovery
- Recovery fails → triggers detection
- Creates 12+ grok consultation logs
- No circuit breaker to stop loops

### 4. State Synchronization Failures
- Database, SessionStateManager, and tmux reality diverge
- No single source of truth
- Polling intervals too long (10+ minutes)

## Recommended Immediate Actions

### 1. Fix Session Name Population
```python
# In tmux_orchestrator_cli.py or scheduler.py
# After creating session, update database:
cursor.execute("""
    UPDATE project_queue 
    SET session_name = ?, 
        orchestrator_session = ?
    WHERE id = ?
""", (session_name, session_name, project_id))
```

### 2. Add Session Health Monitoring
```python
def monitor_session_health(self, session_name):
    """Real-time session monitoring"""
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(['tmux', 'has-session', '-t', session_name], 
                              capture_output=True)
        return result.returncode == 0
    except:
        return False
```

### 3. Implement Circuit Breaker
```python
class RecoveryCircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, max_attempts=3, reset_time=3600):
        self.attempts = {}
        self.max_attempts = max_attempts
        self.reset_time = reset_time
    
    def should_retry(self, project_id):
        if project_id not in self.attempts:
            self.attempts[project_id] = []
        
        # Remove old attempts
        cutoff = time.time() - self.reset_time
        self.attempts[project_id] = [t for t in self.attempts[project_id] if t > cutoff]
        
        if len(self.attempts[project_id]) >= self.max_attempts:
            return False
        
        self.attempts[project_id].append(time.time())
        return True
```

### 4. Improve State Sync
- Reduce polling intervals: 10min → 1min
- Add WebSocket-like notifications for session changes
- Implement two-phase commit for state updates

## Long-Term Architectural Improvements

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture
Replace polling with events:
- Tmux hooks for session create/destroy
- Database triggers for state changes
- Message queue for inter-component communication

### 2. Centralized State Management
- Single source of truth (database)
- State machine enforcement
- Atomic state transitions

### 3. Better Observability
- Structured logging (JSON)
- Distributed tracing
- Metrics collection (Prometheus-style)

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- Unit tests for session detection
- Integration tests for full workflow
- Chaos engineering (kill sessions randomly)

## Recovery Plan for Current Failures

### Project 99 (Active Session)
1. Session is running: `test-spec-713384c9`
2. Update database to reflect reality
3. Monitor for actual completion
4. Investigate why marked as failed

### Project 89 (Dead Session)
1. Session is gone, cannot recover
2. Mark as permanently failed
3. Requires manual re-run if needed
4. Add to post-mortem analysis

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Key Metrics to Track
- Session creation success rate
- Session lifetime distribution
- Recovery attempt frequency
- Error message quality score
- State sync lag time

### Alerts to Implement
- Session death without completion
- Recovery loops (>3 attempts)
- Database/tmux state mismatch
- Subprocess failures with null errors

## Conclusion

The failures reveal fundamental issues in state management and error handling. While individual fixes address symptoms, the system needs architectural improvements for reliability. The discovery of project 99's active session despite "failed" status highlights the severity of state desynchronization.

### Priority Actions
1. **URGENT**: Fix session name population in database
2. **HIGH**: Implement circuit breakers for recovery loops
3. **MEDIUM**: Reduce polling intervals and improve monitoring
4. **LOW**: Refactor for event-driven architecture
