# Tmux Orchestrator Failure Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
Two projects (89 and 99) reported failures in the Tmux Orchestrator system. Project 89 shows as completed but has critical file provisioning issues. Project 99 has a Python NameError preventing agent briefing. Both issues stem from inadequate validation and error handling during project initialization.

## Project 89: Mobile App Spec V2

### Status
- **Reported**: Failed (by user)
- **Logged**: Completed successfully
- **Root Cause**: File provisioning failure during worktree setup

### Issue Details
The system failed to copy CLAUDE.md files to agent worktrees but continued execution:
```
Warning: Could not copy CLAUDE.md to orchestrator: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
Warning: Could not copy CLAUDE.md to project_manager: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
Warning: Could not copy CLAUDE.md to developer: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
Warning: Could not copy CLAUDE.md to tester: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
Warning: Could not copy CLAUDE.md to testrunner: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

### Impact
- Agents lack critical configuration/instruction files
- Project marked successful despite incomplete setup
- Downstream agent failures not captured in status

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing Source File**: CLAUDE.md doesn't exist in the main project directory
2. **Weak Error Handling**: File copy failures logged as warnings, not errors
3. **Incomplete Validation**: Success criteria don't include resource integrity checks
4. **Status Tracking Gap**: Scheduler tracks session liveness but not resource availability

## Project 99: Test Spec (P5)

### Status
- **Reported**: Failed
- **Logged**: Failed with NameError
- **Root Cause**: Python import scoping issue

### Issue Details
```python
File "/home/clauderun/Tmux-Orchestrator/tmux_orchestrator/claude/oauth_manager.py", line 981, in _brief_agents
    briefing_system = BriefingSystem(self.tmux_orchestrator_path)
NameError: name 'BriefingSystem' is not defined
```

### Impact
- Complete failure during agent briefing phase
- Worktrees created but agents never briefed
- Project unusable

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Import Scoping Error**: BriefingSystem is imported inside one method (line 763) but used in another (_brief_agents, line 981)
2. **Local Import Scope**: Python imports inside functions are local to that function
3. **Missing Global Import**: The import statement needs to be at module level or repeated in _brief_agents
4. **Code Structure Issue**: Modular refactoring left imports in wrong scope

## Code Analysis

### oauth_manager.py Structure Issue
```python
# Around line 763 (inside a method, likely __init__)
def some_method(self):
    from ..agents.briefing_system import BriefingSystem  # LOCAL SCOPE
    # ... other code ...

# Around line 981 (different method)
def _brief_agents(self):
    briefing_system = BriefingSystem(...)  # NameError: not in scope!
```

### scheduler.py Validation Gap
- Focuses on session liveness and timeouts
- No resource integrity validation
- Status updates don't check file provisioning
- Success criteria purely based on tmux session states

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes (1-2 Days)

#### Fix Project 99 (BriefingSystem Import)
```python
# Option 1: Move import to module level
from tmux_orchestrator.agents.briefing_system import BriefingSystem

# Option 2: Import in _brief_agents method
def _brief_agents(self):
    from ..agents.briefing_system import BriefingSystem
    briefing_system = BriefingSystem(self.tmux_orchestrator_path)
```

#### Fix Project 89 (File Provisioning)
```python
def validate_resources(self, project_path: str, roles: List[str]):
    """Validate all required files exist before marking success"""
    missing = []
    for role in roles:
        claude_path = Path(project_path) / f"worktrees/{role}/CLAUDE.md"
        if not claude_path.exists():
            missing.append(str(claude_path))
    if missing:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Resource validation failed: {missing}")
```

### Short-Term Improvements (1-2 Weeks)

1. **Unified Validation Layer**
   - Create shared ProjectValidator class
   - Validate files, imports, and sessions before execution
   - Call from both oauth_manager.py and scheduler.py

2. **Enhanced Error Propagation**
   - Convert warnings to exceptions for critical failures
   - Update scheduler status based on resource failures
   - Implement custom exception hierarchy

3. **Import Management**
   - Audit all local imports in methods
   - Move to module level or ensure proper scoping
   - Add import validation to DependencyChecker

### Long-Term Enhancements (1-3 Months)

1. **Modular Architecture Refinement**
   - Extract BriefingSystem to dedicated module
   - Implement dependency injection pattern
   - Create clear interfaces between modules

2. **Configuration-Driven Validation**
   - Define required resources in config file
   - Make validation rules configurable
   - Support project-specific requirements

3. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Add unit tests for file provisioning
   - Test import resolution in isolation
   - Integration tests for oauth_manager â†” scheduler handoff

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify BriefingSystem import fix
- [ ] Test file provisioning with missing CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Validate error escalation to scheduler
- [ ] Check status accuracy after failures
- [ ] Test batch mode concurrency
- [ ] Verify recovery from both failure types

## Conclusion

Both failures stem from inadequate validation and error handling during project initialization. Project 99 has a clear Python scoping bug that's easily fixed. Project 89 reveals a deeper architectural issue where file provisioning failures don't prevent "successful" completion. The recommended fixes address both immediate bugs and systemic gaps in the validation pipeline.

## Action Items

1. **URGENT**: Fix BriefingSystem import scoping (5 minutes)
2. **HIGH**: Add resource validation before marking projects complete (1 hour)
3. **MEDIUM**: Implement unified validation layer (1 week)
4. **LOW**: Refactor for better modularity (ongoing)
