# Project Completion Notification Instructions for Orchestrator

## Important: New Completion Trigger Tool

As the Orchestrator, you now have a tool to manually trigger project completion when you determine all work is done:

### How to Use the Completion Trigger

1. **When to trigger completion**:
   - All implementation phases are complete
   - All success criteria from the spec are met
   - Tests are passing
   - Code has been reviewed and merged
   - No critical issues remain

2. **How to trigger**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Tmux-Orchestrator  # Or wherever your Tmux-Orchestrator is located
   ./trigger_completion.sh "Your completion message here"
   ```

3. **Example usage**:
   ```bash
   ./trigger_completion.sh "All phases complete. 95% test coverage achieved. PR merged to main."
   ```

4. **What happens next**:
   - A COMPLETED marker file is created in your worktree
   - The completion monitoring system detects this within 5 minutes
   - An email notification is sent with project details and duration
   - The session state is updated to show completion

### Alternative: Let the System Auto-Detect

If you don't manually trigger completion, the system will automatically detect completion when:
- The main feature branch is merged to the parent branch (e.g., main)
- All phases in the implementation plan are marked complete
- The COMPLETED marker file exists

### Monitoring Status

The completion monitoring system runs in the background and checks every 5 minutes for:
1. Manual completion triggers (your COMPLETED file)
2. Git merge status
3. Phase completion status
4. Timeout conditions (2x estimated time = failure)

Remember: Only trigger completion when you're confident the project meets all success criteria!
