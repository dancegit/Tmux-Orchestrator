# ðŸŽ¯ ORCHESTRATOR BRIEFING - SYSTEM RESTART

## Current Session Status
- **Session Name**: elliott-wave-5-options-trading-report-generation-mvp-impl-619fd1c8
- **Project Path**: /home/clauderun/signalmatrix/signalmatrix_org/signalmatrix-slice-reporting
- **Spec**: REPORTING_MVP_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- **Status**: Active (but marked as 'failed' in DB - needs investigation)

## Active Team Members
1. **Orchestrator** (Window 0) - You are here
2. **Project Manager** (Window 1) - Active
3. **SysAdmin** (Window 2) - Active
4. **Developer** (Window 3) - Active
5. **Tester** (Window 4) - Active

## System Health Update
The Tmux Orchestrator monitoring system has been completely overhauled to fix flooding issues:

### âœ… All Monitoring Components Running:
- **state_updater** (PID: 551240) - Updates session state from events
- **compliance_monitor** (PID: 551248) - Monitors communication compliance
- **credit_monitor** (PID: 551249) - Tracks Claude credit usage
- **scheduler** (PID: 551250) - Manages task scheduling

### ðŸ”§ Key Changes:
1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: All monitoring now uses rate-limited event bus
2. **File Logging**: Events logged to `logs/events/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`
3. **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 10 messages/minute to prevent flooding
4. **Critical Alerts Only**: You'll only receive tmux messages for high-priority issues

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Self-Schedule Regular Check-ins
You need to schedule yourself for regular oversight. Use:
```bash
cd ~/gitrepos/Tmux-Orchestrator
CURRENT_WINDOW="elliott-wave-5-options-trading-report-generation-mvp-impl-619fd1c8:0"
./schedule_with_note.sh 30 "Team status check and coordination" "$CURRENT_WINDOW"
```

### 2. Check Team Status
Gather status from each team member:
```bash
# Check PM status
./send-claude-message.sh elliott-wave-5-options-trading-report-generation-mvp-impl-619fd1c8:1 "STATUS UPDATE: Please provide current project status, any blockers, and team coordination needs"

# Check SysAdmin
./send-claude-message.sh elliott-wave-5-options-trading-report-generation-mvp-impl-619fd1c8:2 "STATUS UPDATE: System deployment status and any infrastructure issues?"

# Check Developer  
./send-claude-message.sh elliott-wave-5-options-trading-report-generation-mvp-impl-619fd1c8:3 "STATUS UPDATE: Current implementation progress and any technical blockers?"

# Check Tester
./send-claude-message.sh elliott-wave-5-options-trading-report-generation-mvp-impl-619fd1c8:4 "STATUS UPDATE: Test suite status and any quality concerns?"
```

### 3. Project Status Investigation
The project is marked as 'failed' in the database but the session is active. You should:
1. Determine why the project status is 'failed'
2. Check if the team is aware and actively working
3. Update project status if appropriate

### 4. Review Project Goals
The project appears to be implementing a Reporting MVP for SignalMatrix. Key files to review:
- Spec: `/home/clauderun/signalmatrix/signalmatrix_org/signalmatrix-slice-reporting/REPORTING_MVP_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- Project directory: `/home/clauderun/signalmatrix/signalmatrix_org/signalmatrix-slice-reporting`

### 5. Credit Status Check
One agent was detected as exhausted (window 0:0). Run:
```bash
cd ~/gitrepos/Tmux-Orchestrator
./credit_management/check_agent_health.sh
```

## Available Tools
From the Tmux-Orchestrator directory:
- `./send-claude-message.sh` - Communicate with agents
- `./schedule_with_note.sh` - Schedule check-ins
- `./orchestrator_manager.sh status` - Check monitoring system
- `python3 claude_control.py` - Advanced control options
- `./credit_management/check_agent_health.sh` - Credit status

## Communication Protocol Reminder
- **Hub-and-Spoke Model**: All critical updates should flow through you
- **30-Minute Commit Rule**: Ensure developers commit regularly
- **Quality Standards**: PM should maintain high standards
- **Use Monitored Messaging**: Always use `scm` or `./send-monitored-message.sh`

## Next Steps
1. Self-schedule for 30-minute check-ins
2. Gather status from all team members
3. Investigate project 'failed' status
4. Review project goals and progress
5. Coordinate any blockers or issues
6. Ensure proper git workflow is being followed

Remember: You're the hub - maintain oversight without micromanaging. Trust your team but verify progress.
