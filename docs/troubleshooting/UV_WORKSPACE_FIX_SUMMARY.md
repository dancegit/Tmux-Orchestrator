# UV Workspace Configuration Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
The Tmux-Orchestrator was experiencing UV workspace detection issues that blocked deployment. UV commands were failing when agents worked in git worktrees that weren't configured as UV workspaces.

## Solution Implemented
An ephemeral UV configuration approach that:
- Sets `UV_NO_WORKSPACE=1` to bypass workspace detection
- Works transparently in any project (with or without UV workspaces)
- Leaves no persistent files in target projects
- Prevents accidental commits of UV artifacts

## Implementation Details

### 1. Global Environment Variable (Core Scripts)
Added `UV_NO_WORKSPACE=1` at the start of:
- **auto_orchestrate.py** - Main orchestration script
- **scheduler.py** - Task scheduling daemon

```python
# Set UV_NO_WORKSPACE environment variable for all subprocess calls
import os
os.environ['UV_NO_WORKSPACE'] = '1'
```

### 2. Per-Window UV Environment Setup
Created `setup_agent_uv_environment()` function in auto_orchestrate.py that:
- Sets `UV_NO_WORKSPACE=1` for each tmux window
- Configures isolated UV cache directory per agent
- Runs before Claude starts in each window

```python
def setup_agent_uv_environment(self, session_name: str, window_idx: int, role_key: str):
    """Set up UV environment for an agent's tmux window to work in worktrees"""
    # Set UV_NO_WORKSPACE for this specific tmux window
    subprocess.run([
        'tmux', 'set-environment', '-t', f'{session_name}:{window_idx}', 
        'UV_NO_WORKSPACE', '1'
    ], check=True, capture_output=True)
    
    # Set a custom cache dir to avoid polluting target
    cache_dir = f"/tmp/tmux-orchestrator-uv-cache-{session_name}-{role_key}"
    subprocess.run([
        'tmux', 'set-environment', '-t', f'{session_name}:{window_idx}',
        'UV_CACHE_DIR', cache_dir
    ], check=True, capture_output=True)
```

### 3. Agent Briefing Instructions
Added UV configuration instructions to ALL agent briefings:

```markdown
üîß **UV CONFIGURATION (CRITICAL)**:
- `UV_NO_WORKSPACE=1` is set in your environment
- This allows UV commands to work without workspace detection
- You can run UV commands normally: `uv run`, `uv pip install`, etc.
- UV cache is isolated to prevent target project pollution

‚ö†Ô∏è **GIT SAFETY RULES**:
- NEVER commit `.venv`, `__pycache__`, or UV cache directories
- Before commits: `git status --porcelain | grep -E '\.venv|__pycache__|uv-cache'`
- If temp files detected: Add them to `.gitignore` or use `git add -p`
- ALWAYS review `git status` before committing
- Use selective staging (`git add -p`) instead of `git add .` or `git add -A`
```

### 4. Testing
Created comprehensive tests to verify:
- UV_NO_WORKSPACE environment variable is set correctly
- UV commands execute successfully
- Tmux window environment configuration works
- Integration with auto_orchestrate.py and scheduler.py

## Key Benefits

1. **Zero Configuration Required**: Works automatically for all projects
2. **No Persistent Files**: Nothing added to target repositories
3. **Git Safety**: Clear instructions prevent accidental commits
4. **Isolated Caches**: Each agent has its own UV cache directory
5. **Backwards Compatible**: Works with existing UV projects

## Usage

Agents can now run UV commands normally in their worktrees:
```bash
# All of these work without workspace errors
uv run python script.py
uv pip install requests
uv run --script my_script.py
```

## Verification

Run the test suite to verify configuration:
```bash
# Unit tests
UV_NO_WORKSPACE=1 python3 test_uv_configuration.py

# Integration tests
./test_integration_uv.sh
```

## Future Improvements

Low priority task remains to add UV_NO_WORKSPACE=1 to other Python scripts with UV shebangs:
- ai_team_refiner.py
- chaos_tester.py
- claude_control.py
- concurrent_orchestration.py
- dynamic_team.py
- email_notifier.py
- And others...

However, the core functionality is fully operational as these scripts are either:
- Called by auto_orchestrate.py or scheduler.py (which set the env var)
- Run independently and can have UV_NO_WORKSPACE=1 set when needed
