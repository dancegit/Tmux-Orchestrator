# Fix Summary: Agent Briefing Path Issues

## Problem Identified
- Agent briefings contained incorrect relative paths (e.g., `../../Tmux-Orchestrator/CLAUDE.md`)
- Initial commands used `cd {self.project_path}` pointing to original project directory instead of worktrees
- This caused "cd blocked" errors and prevented agents from accessing required files

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Initial Commands (auto_orchestrate.py)
- Modified all agent initial commands to be worktree-aware
- Added `pwd` as first command to verify location
- Changed `cd {project_path}` to `cd ./shared/main-project || cd {project_path}`
- This ensures agents try to use shared symlinks first, with fallback to original path

### 2. Fixed Orchestrator CLAUDE.md Path
- Changed from relative path calculation to absolute path: `/home/clauderun/Tmux-Orchestrator/CLAUDE.md`
- This prevents issues like `../../Tmux-Orchestrator/CLAUDE.md` not being found

### 3. Fixed LogTracker CLAUDE.md References
- Updated to check shared directory first, then fall back to project path
- Added error handling with 2>/dev/null and fallback messages

### 4. Created Helper Module
- `briefing_path_fixer.py` - Can be used to fix briefings dynamically
- Provides functions to fix paths in briefings before they're sent to agents

## Impact on Project 73

The current Project 73 agents were briefed with the old incorrect paths. They need to be:
1. Either restarted with the new fixed briefings
2. Or manually corrected with updated paths

## Recommended Actions for Project 73

### Option 1: Restart Failed Agents (Recommended)
```bash
# Kill and restart the affected agents
tmux kill-window -t integrated-deployment-spec-orchestration:3  # Tester
tmux kill-window -t integrated-deployment-spec-orchestration:2  # Developer
tmux kill-window -t integrated-deployment-spec-orchestration:1  # Project Manager

# Then use the orchestrator's restart functionality
cd /home/clauderun/Tmux-Orchestrator
python3 auto_orchestrate.py --resume integrated-deployment-spec-orchestration
# Choose option 3 (restart and rebrief all)
```

### Option 2: Manual Path Correction
Send correction messages to each agent:
```
The path references in your briefing were incorrect. Please note:
- Your working directory should be your worktree, not the original project
- To access the main project, use: cd ./shared/main-project
- The orchestrator CLAUDE.md is at: /home/clauderun/Tmux-Orchestrator/CLAUDE.md
- Run 'pwd' and 'ls -la shared/' to verify your location
```

## Prevention for Future Projects

All new orchestrations will now use the corrected paths automatically. The fixes ensure:
- Agents start in their worktrees
- Shared directories are checked before falling back
- Absolute paths are used for orchestrator files
- Error handling prevents "file not found" issues

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works for new projects:
1. Start a new orchestration
2. Check that agents run `pwd` as their first command
3. Verify they can access shared/main-project
4. Confirm no "cd blocked" errors occur
