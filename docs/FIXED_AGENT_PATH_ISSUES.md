# Fixed: Agent Briefing Path Issues

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### 1. Initial Commands Fixed (auto_orchestrate.py)
All agent initial commands have been updated to be worktree-aware:
- Added `pwd` as first command to verify location
- Changed hardcoded `cd {self.project_path}` to try shared directory first: `cd ./shared/main-project || cd {self.project_path}`
- This prevents "cd blocked" security errors

### 2. Orchestrator CLAUDE.md Path Fixed
- Changed from relative path (`../../Tmux-Orchestrator/CLAUDE.md`) to absolute path: `/home/clauderun/Tmux-Orchestrator/CLAUDE.md`
- This prevents "File does not exist" errors when agents try to read the mandatory rules

### 3. Project CLAUDE.md References Fixed
- Updated logtracker and other agents to check shared directory first
- Added error handling with fallbacks

### 4. Created Helper Modules
- `fix_agent_briefing_paths.py` - The main fix script (already run)
- `briefing_path_fixer.py` - Module for dynamic briefing path fixing
- `restart_project_73.py` - Script to restart Project 73 with corrected paths

## What This Fixes

Before:
- Agents received paths like `../../Tmux-Orchestrator/CLAUDE.md` that didn't exist from their worktree perspective
- Agents tried to `cd /home/clauderun/project-name` which was blocked by security
- This caused agents to get stuck and fail to start properly

After:
- Agents use absolute paths for orchestrator files
- Agents check for shared/ directory and use symlinks when available
- Fallback paths ensure agents can work even without symlinks
- No more "cd blocked" or "file not found" errors

## Impact

- All future orchestrations will use the corrected paths automatically
- Existing orchestrations (like Project 73) need to be restarted to get the fixes
- The fix ensures agents can work properly in both worktree and non-worktree environments

## To Restart Project 73

Run:
```bash
python3 /home/clauderun/Tmux-Orchestrator/restart_project_73.py
```

Then choose option 3 when prompted to restart and re-brief all agents.

## Verification

After restarting, agents should:
1. Run `pwd` as their first command
2. Successfully read `/home/clauderun/Tmux-Orchestrator/CLAUDE.md`
3. Be able to access the main project via `cd ./shared/main-project`
4. Not encounter any "cd blocked" errors
