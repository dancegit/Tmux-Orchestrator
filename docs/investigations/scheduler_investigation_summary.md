# Scheduler Investigation Summary

## Collection Time
- Date: 2025-08-25 23:35 UTC

## Files Collected
1. **scheduler_logs_tail.txt** - Last 100 lines of scheduler.log
2. **journalctl_queue_service.txt** - Last 50 lines of journalctl for tmux-orchestrator-queue.service
3. **scheduled_tasks.txt** - Output of scheduler.py --list
4. **scheduler_processes.txt** - Running scheduler processes
5. **scheduler_errors.txt** - Recent errors from scheduler.log
6. **pending_tasks.txt** - Upcoming tasks from the database
7. **systemd_status.txt** - Systemd service status
8. **scheduler_lifecycle.txt** - Scheduler start/stop/error events
9. **lock_files.txt** - Lock file listing

## Initial Observations

### Key Finding from scheduler.py --list output:
```
2025-08-25 23:35:31,904 - scheduler_lock_manager - WARNING - Removing old lock from 2025-08-25 19:30:58.670378 (process 2434453 may be hung)
2025-08-25 23:35:32,045 - __main__ - ERROR - Error updating lock heartbeat: 'TmuxOrchestratorScheduler' object has no attribute 'lock_fd'
```

This shows:
1. There was a hung scheduler process (PID 2434453) from earlier today
2. The new scheduler instance has an error with the lock heartbeat mechanism
3. The scheduler is starting but immediately encountering an attribute error

### Recommended Investigation Points for Grok:
1. Why is the lock heartbeat mechanism failing with missing 'lock_fd' attribute?
2. Is there a race condition between scheduler instances?
3. Are tasks being scheduled but not executed due to the lock issues?
4. Why did the previous scheduler process (2434453) hang?

## Next Steps
Include all collected files in the Grok discussion for comprehensive analysis.
