CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE - PRODUCTION DATA BREACH
================================================
Created: 2025-06-16
Status: ACTIVE - REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACTION

CURRENT SITUATION:
------------------
1. PRODUCTION DATA BREACH: Production server (klaviyo-backend.onrender.com) is exposing ALL 38 accounts' data 
   - Should only show Hulist data
   - Critical security vulnerability affecting multiple accounts
   - Production frontend is currently using this compromised endpoint

2. LOCAL FIX COMPLETED: Both required fixes have been implemented locally
   - Routing fix: Updated to use account-specific routing
   - DuckDB view name fix: Corrected view naming convention
   - Local testing shows fixes work correctly

3. ENVIRONMENT MISMATCH: 
   - Frontend: Testing against PRODUCTION backend (with data breach)
   - Backend: Fixed LOCALLY but not deployed
   - This mismatch is masking the severity of the production issue

4. DEPLOYMENT BLOCKER: Cannot deploy without user intervention
   - Render deployment requires manual action
   - User credentials/access needed for production deployment

IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS:
-----------------------
[ ] URGENT: Deploy backend fixes to production
    - This is a SECURITY CRITICAL deployment
    - All customer data is currently exposed
    - Deploy from glacier-backend window

[ ] Verify deployment success
    - Test production endpoint returns only Hulist data
    - Confirm other accounts' data is no longer accessible

[ ] Update frontend configuration if needed
    - Ensure frontend continues to work with fixed backend
    - May need to update API endpoints or authentication

[ ] Post-deployment verification
    - Full end-to-end test with production data
    - Verify data isolation is working correctly
    - Check all 38 accounts to ensure proper segmentation

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
------------------
- Issue: Production DuckDB views exposing all account data
- Root cause: Missing account-specific filtering in views
- Fix location: glacier-backend (local)
- Deployment target: klaviyo-backend.onrender.com
- Risk level: CRITICAL - Customer data exposure

MONITORING NOTES:
-----------------
- Monitor glacier-backend window for deployment status
- Watch for any error messages during deployment
- Keep user informed of progress
- Do not proceed with other tasks until this is resolved

USER NOTIFICATION REQUIRED:
---------------------------
This is a CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE that requires immediate user intervention for deployment.
All other development work should be paused until this is resolved.
