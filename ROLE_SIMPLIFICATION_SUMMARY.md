# Role Simplification Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `auto_orchestrate.py`

Modified the `get_roles_for_project_size()` method to always deploy only 4 core roles:
- **Orchestrator**: Central coordination hub
- **Developer**: Implementation and code writing
- **Tester**: Test creation and quality verification
- **TestRunner**: Automated test execution

This applies to all project sizes (small, medium, large) - no variation.

### 2. Updated `CLAUDE.md`

- **Core Roles Section**: Updated to show only the 4 essential roles
- **Optional Roles Section**: Moved Project Manager, Researcher, LogTracker, DevOps, Code Reviewer, and Documentation Writer to optional roles that can be added with `--roles` flag
- **Role Communication Matrix**: Simplified to show direct Orchestrator-to-agent communication
- **Hub-and-Spoke Model**: Updated to show Orchestrator as the central hub (no PM intermediary)
- **Worktree Locations**: Updated to show only the 4 core role directories
- **Default Role Deployment**: Changed from size-based to single consistent deployment

### 3. Updated `README.md`

- **Architecture Diagram**: Updated to show streamlined structure with Orchestrator managing Developer, Tester, and TestRunner directly
- **Examples**: Updated to remove Project Manager references
- **Quick Start**: Modified example to have Developer receive specs directly from Orchestrator
- **Feature Description**: Changed to emphasize "Core Agent Team" instead of varying team sizes

## Benefits of Simplification

1. **Reduced Token Consumption**: Fewer agents means approximately 60% less token usage
2. **Simpler Communication**: Direct Orchestrator coordination eliminates communication overhead
3. **Faster Setup**: Less complexity in deployment and configuration
4. **Clearer Responsibilities**: Each role has well-defined, non-overlapping duties
5. **Easier Management**: Orchestrator can directly manage all agents without intermediaries

## Migration Notes

- Existing projects using the old role structure will continue to work
- The `--roles` flag can still add any of the optional roles if needed
- The simplified structure is now the default for all new projects
- Token consumption is optimized for longer coding sessions

## Usage

```bash
# Standard deployment (4 agents)
./auto_orchestrate.py --project /path/to/project --spec spec.md

# Add optional roles if needed
./auto_orchestrate.py --project /path/to/project --spec spec.md --roles project_manager researcher
```
