# Event-Delivery Architecture Specification

## Project Overview
Design and implement a robust, scalable event-delivery system that provides reliable message passing between distributed services with support for event sourcing, message ordering, and guaranteed delivery patterns.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Event Bus Architecture
- Implement a central event bus that can handle high-throughput message passing
- Support for multiple message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Streams, NATS)
- Pluggable architecture for adding new transport layers
- Event routing based on topics, patterns, and content-based filtering

### 2. Message Delivery Guarantees
- **At-least-once delivery**: Ensure messages are delivered at least once
- **At-most-once delivery**: Option for fire-and-forget scenarios
- **Exactly-once delivery**: Support for idempotent message processing
- Message acknowledgment and retry mechanisms
- Dead letter queues for failed messages

### 3. Event Sourcing
- Event store for maintaining complete event history
- Event replay capabilities for system recovery
- Snapshot mechanism for performance optimization
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) support
- Event versioning and schema evolution

### 4. Message Ordering
- Preserve message order within partitions/channels
- Support for ordered and unordered delivery modes
- Causal ordering for related events
- Global ordering options with performance trade-offs

### 5. Scalability & Performance
- Horizontal scaling of event processors
- Partitioning strategies for load distribution
- Backpressure handling to prevent system overload
- Batch processing capabilities
- Async/await patterns throughout

### 6. Resilience & Fault Tolerance
- Circuit breakers for failing services
- Automatic failover and recovery
- Health checks and monitoring endpoints
- Graceful degradation under load
- Message persistence and durability

### 7. Security
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive events
- Authentication and authorization for publishers/subscribers
- Message signing and verification
- Audit logging of all events
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection

### 8. Observability
- Distributed tracing for event flows
- Metrics collection (throughput, latency, error rates)
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Real-time monitoring dashboards
- Alerting for anomalies and failures

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Event Gateway**
   - REST/gRPC/WebSocket APIs for event publishing
   - Client SDKs for major languages (Python, Node.js, Go, Java)
   - Schema validation and transformation
   - Rate limiting and authentication

2. **Message Broker Layer**
   - Abstraction over different message brokers
   - Connection pooling and management
   - Automatic reconnection and failover
   - Performance optimization per broker type

3. **Event Processor Framework**
   - Worker pools for concurrent processing
   - Event handler registration and discovery
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - State management for stateful processors

4. **Event Store**
   - Append-only event log
   - Indexing for efficient queries
   - Compaction and archival strategies
   - Multi-region replication

5. **Control Plane**
   - Service discovery and registration
   - Configuration management
   - Dynamic scaling policies
   - Deployment orchestration

### Data Flow

```
Publishers → Gateway → Validation → Router → Broker → Processors → Store
                ↓                      ↓                    ↓
            Metrics              Dead Letter Q          Snapshots
```

## Technology Stack

### Required
- **Languages**: Go (core system), Python/Node.js (SDKs)
- **Message Brokers**: Redis Streams (default), Kafka, RabbitMQ
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL (event store), Redis (cache)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry
- **Container**: Docker, Kubernetes

### Optional
- **Stream Processing**: Apache Flink, Kafka Streams
- **API Gateway**: Kong, Envoy
- **Service Mesh**: Istio, Linkerd
- **Cloud Services**: AWS Kinesis, Google Pub/Sub, Azure Event Hubs

## Constraints & Considerations

1. **Message Size**: Support events up to 1MB, with streaming for larger payloads
2. **Retention**: Configurable retention (7 days default, up to 1 year)
3. **Ordering**: Maintain order within partition, not globally
4. **Latency**: Optimize for low latency over absolute consistency
5. **Cost**: Design for cost-effective operation at scale

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: 90% code coverage minimum
2. **Integration Tests**: Test all broker integrations
3. **Chaos Testing**: Simulate failures and network partitions
4. **Load Testing**: Verify performance under stress
5. **End-to-End Tests**: Validate complete event flows

## Documentation Requirements

1. **Architecture Guide**: System design and component interactions
2. **API Reference**: Complete API documentation with examples
3. **SDK Guides**: Language-specific integration guides
4. **Operations Manual**: Deployment, monitoring, and troubleshooting
5. **Best Practices**: Event design patterns and anti-patterns
